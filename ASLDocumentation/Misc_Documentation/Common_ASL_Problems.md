# Common Problems with ASL Setup:

This is a list of issues that commonly occur during users' first ASL setup. If
you encounter something different and would like to have it added to this list
let us know!


### Problem: Cannot find the com.google.arcore... file OR Unity is giving you an error along the lines of "no git executable was found"

Solution: You either don't have git installed, OR you don't have it added to your path.

• If you don't have Git, the easiest way to get it is by installing GitHub Desktop for Windows. Get it here: https://desktop.github.com/

• Once you've installed Git, follow the instructions here to add it to your path: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26620312/git-installing-git-in-path-with-github-client-for-windows

• Restart your computer to ensure the environment variables update. Then try opening your ASL project again.
